  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> I am working towards having more focus and consistency in my daily life.
    This can include completing school work or learning a new hobby but within an efficient amount of time.
    My past experience with not being able to follow through on projects I was working on has lead me to pursue this goal. 
    I am working toward this goal by becoming more organized and maintaining a schedule.
    Discipline and consistency are essential for maintaining good habits and having a balanced life.
    I am hoping to have some sort of plan or goals for life after high school soon.
    I also would like to get a job or learn a new activity in the free time that I have. 
    I want to be most known for being a hardworking, well-spoken, and generous person.
    I also want to be known for achieving success in my career while also being very family oriented.
